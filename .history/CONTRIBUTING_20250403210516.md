## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
2. Implement your changes in the `src` directory
3. Run `npm run lint` to check for code issues
4. Run `npm run format` to format your code
5. Test your changes with `npm run build` and the MCP Inspector
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
7. Push your branch to GitHub

## Coding Standards

This project uses TypeScript and follows specific coding standards:

- Use TypeScript's strict mode
- Follow the [TypeScript Best Practices](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html)
- Use interfaces for object definitions
- Make properties readonly when appropriate
- Use proper typing for all variables and functions
- Include JSDoc comments for public API methods
- Follow the existing code style and formatting

ESLint and Prettier are used to enforce code quality and formatting:

```bash
npm run lint       # Check for code issues
npm run lint:fix   # Fix code issues automatically
npm run format     # Format code with Prettier
```

## Key Components

### MCP Server Implementation

The core of this project is the MCP server implementation in `src/index.ts`. The main class is `Panda3DDocsServer`, which:

1. Sets up an MCP server with tool handlers
2. Uses Puppeteer to search the Panda3D documentation
3. Processes and formats the search results
4. Returns the formatted content through MCP

### Main Features

- **Puppeteer Integration**: Uses a headless browser to search and extract content from the Panda3D docs
- **MCP Tool Handler**: Implements the `get_docs` tool for Claude to access documentation
- **Debug Logging**: Includes comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

## Submitting Changes

1. Ensure your code passes all linting and format checks
2. Push your changes to your fork
3. Create a pull request to the main repository
4. Describe your changes in detail in the pull request
5. Reference any related issues

Thank you for contributing to the Panda3D Documentation Server!
