# Panda3D Documentation Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude to search and retrieve Panda3D documentation seamlessly during conversations.

## What is Panda3D?

Panda3D is a powerful, open-source 3D game engine and rendering library. Originally developed by Disney and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, it provides:

- A complete framework for 3D rendering, physics, animation, and game development
- Python and C++ APIs for development flexibility
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Advanced features like shader support, scene graph architecture, and collision detection

Panda3D is used in both commercial games and academic research projects, making it a valuable tool for game developers, researchers, and students.

## What This Server Does

This MCP server serves as a bridge between Claude and the official Panda3D documentation. It:

1. Receives documentation queries from Claude through the Model Context Protocol
2. Uses Puppeteer to search the official Panda3D documentation website
3. Parses and extracts relevant information from search results
4. Returns formatted documentation content back to Claude

Under the hood, the server:

- Launches a headless browser using Puppeteer
- Performs searches on the Panda3D documentation site (<https://docs.panda3d.org>)
- Extracts search results and detailed content
- Formats the information for optimal readability in Claude
- Provides both a summary of search results and in-depth documentation

## Features

- **Semantic Documentation Search**: Finds relevant Panda3D classes, functions, and concepts
- **Rich Results**: Returns both search result listings and detailed content
- **Smart Prioritization**: Identifies the most relevant result for specific queries
- **Debug Information**: Includes detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **MCP Integration**: Works seamlessly within Claude conversations
