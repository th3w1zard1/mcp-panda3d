# Panda3D Documentation Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude to search and retrieve Panda3D documentation seamlessly during conversations.

## What is Panda3D?

Panda3D is a powerful, open-source 3D game engine and rendering library. Originally developed by Disney and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, it provides:

- A complete framework for 3D rendering, physics, animation, and game development
- Python and C++ APIs for development flexibility
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Advanced features like shader support, scene graph architecture, and collision detection

Panda3D is used in both commercial games and academic research projects, making it a valuable tool for game developers, researchers, and students.

## What This Server Does

This MCP server serves as a bridge between Claude and the official Panda3D documentation. It:

1. Receives documentation queries from Claude through the Model Context Protocol
2. Uses Puppeteer to search the official Panda3D documentation website
3. Parses and extracts relevant information from search results
4. Returns formatted documentation content back to Claude

Under the hood, the server:

- Launches a headless browser using Puppeteer
- Performs searches on the Panda3D documentation site (<https://docs.panda3d.org>)
- Extracts search results and detailed content
- Formats the information for optimal readability in Claude
- Provides both a summary of search results and in-depth documentation

## Features

- **Semantic Documentation Search**: Finds relevant Panda3D classes, functions, and concepts
- **Rich Results**: Returns both search result listings and detailed content
- **Smart Prioritization**: Identifies the most relevant result for specific queries
- **Debug Information**: Includes detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **MCP Integration**: Works seamlessly within Claude conversations

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/panda3d-docs-server.git
   cd panda3d-docs-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the server:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Configuration with Claude

### For Claude Desktop

Add the server configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**Windows**:
Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**macOS**:
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration (replace with your actual installation path):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "panda3d-docs-server": {
      "command": "C:/path/to/panda3d-docs-server/build/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude to search the Panda3D documentation:

```
@panda3d-docs-server get_docs query="ShowBase class"
```

Additional parameters:

- `check_keywords`: Search in module names and titles (default: true)
- `search_contents`: Search in docstrings and code (default: false)

Example with all parameters:

```
@panda3d-docs-server get_docs query="collision detection" check_keywords=true search_contents=true
```

Claude will return a formatted response including:

1. A list of search results with links
2. Detailed documentation for the most relevant result
3. Debug information for troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation

This server is built with:

- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **MCP SDK**: For implementing the Model Context Protocol
- **Puppeteer**: For headless browser automation to scrape documentation
- **Node.js**: For the runtime environment

The server works by:

1. Setting up an MCP server with a `get_docs` tool
2. Using Puppeteer to search the Panda3D documentation site
3. Parsing HTML results to extract relevant information
4. Formatting and returning the content through the MCP interface

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Watch Mode (for development)

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
npm run lint       # Check for code issues
npm run lint:fix   # Fix code issues automatically
npm run format     # Format code with Prettier
```

### Debug with MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector provides a web interface for debugging:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

Access the inspector in your browser at the URL provided in the console.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Server not found**: Ensure your configuration path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct
- **Search returns no results**: Check your query format and try more general terms
- **Browser initialization errors**: Make sure your system has a compatible browser for Puppeteer
- **Timeout errors**: The server might time out for complex queries or slow connections
